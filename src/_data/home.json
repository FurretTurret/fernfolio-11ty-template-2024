  "body": "Hi! I'm Nate (it/he)! I'm a gameplay programmer, musician, and generalist with 10 years of experience with Unity. I release solo indie games as Sketch House Games, and I've previously worked at Unity and Microsoft.\n\nI﻿ make games with good software engineering practices in mind, with a focus on testability and human readability. I love games that play with multiple genres at once, and I want to work towards a more equitable world.\n\n[Download my résumé (with contact info).](https://natebuck.netlify.app/assets/img/NateBuck_Resume_2024.pdf)"
