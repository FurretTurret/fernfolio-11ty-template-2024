***A sample game teaching Unity multiplayer features, released in 2021***

The Game Lobby Sample was co-developed under contract with Unity in 2021. I worked with technical artist Jacob Stove-Lorentzen to create a minimal game utilizing an assortment of then-upcoming online multiplayer features, with the goal of providing a reference point for developers alongside those features' release. Developers can run local or online instances and follow documentation to learn how to implement multiplayer rooms with synchronized states and audio in their own games.

* We coordinated with other teams to integrate in-development features, including Addressables, Vivox, Remote Config, Cloud Content Delivery, and others. We provided early feedback by dogfooding their internal releases and identifying how to coordinate their implementation, "making it work" with the tools in their pre-release state.
* I was responsible for overall software engineering, with a focus on maintaining separable assemblies so developers could experiment with features in isolation. Regarding features, I focused on Addressables, Vivox, and Remote Config.﻿ I also provided initial documentation and guides to our technical writer leading to the Unity Learn content for the sample.
* We also worked on a larger unreleased project named #SquadGoals, a 5v5 action-sports game similarly using multiple multiplayer features. It was not completed, although basic functionality worked and we ran remote multiplayer playtests.
* I﻿ took time to instruct Jacob on good engineering practices, such that he was able to transition into continued engineering work after my contract ended. We've both made ongoing use of best practices learned from each other.
