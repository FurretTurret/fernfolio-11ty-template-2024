##### A sample game teaching Unity multiplayer features

![Un﻿ity's Game Lobby Sample demonstrated on three clients](/src/assets/img/gamelobbysamplescreen.jpg)

The Game Lobby Sample was co-developed under contract with Unity. I worked with technical artist Jacob Stove-Lorentzen to create a minimal game utilizing an assortment of then-upcoming multiplayer features, with the goal of providing a reference point for developers alongside those features' release.

* We coordinated with other teams to integrate in-development features, including Addressables, Vivox, Remote Config, Cloud Content Delivery, and others. While some of these were not released, we provided valuable feedback by dogfooding their internal releases.
* We also worked on a larger unreleased project named #SquadGoals, a 5v5 action-sports game similarly using multiple multiplayer features, though it was not completed.
* I was responsible for overall software engineering, with a focus on maintaining separable assemblies so developers could experiment with features in isolation, and regarding features I focused on Addressables, Vivox, and Remote Config.﻿
* I﻿ also took time to instruct Jacob on good engineering practices, such that he was able to transition into continued engineering work after my contract ended. We've both made ongoing use of best practices learned from each other.
