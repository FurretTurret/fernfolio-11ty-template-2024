##### A﻿ challenging minigame party game with no luck involved, released in 2020

M﻿onster Jaunt was developed as a solo project, with 23 minigames in a variety of genres. The minigames, as well as the strategic board game layer connecting them, were designed to be challenging for skilled players, with high depth and replayability. It released in February of 2020 with a content update a few months later.

* Frequent and early playtesting allowed for quick prototyping of new minigames. I iterated quickly on minigame mechanics and designs and was able to balance the goal of high variety with the budget and limitations on my capabilities.
* I﻿ focused on using software patterns early to create a solid foundation, with custom time and random functions as well as Observer and Messenger patterns built on top of the basic Unity features, and with moderate unit testing from the onset.
* L﻿ater in development, I found ways to refactor and combine assets for shared use between multiple minigames, increasing the speed at which new minigames could be fully implemented.
* The low-poly, N64-inspired style provided a means of learning 3D modeling and animation basics, and it made it possible to prioritize a diverse cast instead of generic player characters.
* This was my first commercial release, with all the lessons learned from that, including Steam integration and platform basics (as well as Discord's storefront at the time), contracting 2D artists for monster art, and working with translators and voice actors.
